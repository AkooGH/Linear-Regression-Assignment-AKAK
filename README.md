# Linear Regression Assignment – Akash Komarla

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the application of **Linear Regression** on a dataset using Python. The project was completed as part of a machine learning assignment and includes exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `Linear_Regression_Assignment_AkashKomarla.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all code, visualizations, and explanations.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this assignment was to:
- Understand the fundamentals of linear regression.
- Apply linear regression to a real-world dataset.
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Train and evaluate a regression model using scikit-learn.
- Interpret the model's performance using metrics like R² score and RMSE.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

## 📈 Key Highlights

- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps including handling missing values and encoding.
- Visualizations to understand feature relationships and distributions.
- Model training using `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.
- Evaluation using metrics such as:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
